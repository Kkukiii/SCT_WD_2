# SCT_WD_2

This project is a Calculator Web Application created as part of Task 02 (Alternative) to strengthen frontend development skills. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on DOM manipulation, event handling, and input parsing. Users can interact with the calculator through both button clicks and keyboard inputs. Special attention has been given to error handling (e.g., divide-by-zero errors) and creating a clean, responsive user interface. This task serves as a hands-on practice to improve JavaScript logic implementation and UI development in real-world scenarios.
